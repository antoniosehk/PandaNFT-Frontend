## Inspiration
Miniting NFT should be fun! Gamification is brought into NFT minitng through Chainlink keeper and Chainlink VRF v2.

## What it does
Each day Chainlink keeper will increase the mint price of the NFT. You can either mint based on a daily increasing fee or pay a fixed fee to enroll into a luck draw, supported by Chainlink VRF v2, to get 10 NFTs !

## How we built it
- The smart contract was written in Solidity (ERC721A) using Hardhat
   - Chainlink keeper was used to call the increaseMintFee daily
   - Chainlink VRF was used for the randomness
- The front-end was built using React, with Rainbowkit and Wagmi / view, hosted on Vercel
- Dapp was deployed in both Sepolia and Goerli

## Challenges we ran into
- Issues related to using Chainlink keeper and VRF
- Issues related to front-end to have the best UX

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- The dapp is fully functional !

## What we learned
- Improved skills in smart contract development
- Improved skills in front-end development
- Improved understanding in Chainlink products

## What's next for Panda NFT
- Have more gamification features !
